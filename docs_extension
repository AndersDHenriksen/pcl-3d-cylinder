Common PointCloud2 field names
Because field names are generic in the new PointCloud2 message, here's the list of commonly used names within PCL:
x - the X Cartesian coordinate of a point (float32)
y - the Y Cartesian coordinate of a point (float32)
z - the Z Cartesian coordinate of a point (float32)
rgb - the RGB (24-bit packed) color at a point (uint32)
rgba - the A-RGB (32-bit packed) color at a point (uint32), the field name is unfortunately misleading
normal_x - the first component of the normal direction vector at a point (float32)
normal_y - the second component of the normal direction vector at a point (float32)
normal_z - the third component of the normal direction vector at a point (float32)
curvature - the surface curvature change estimate at a point (float32)
j1 - the first moment invariant at a point (float32)
j2 - the second moment invariant at a point (float32)
j3 - the third moment invariant at a point (float32)
boundary_point - the boundary property of a point (e.g., set to 1 if the point is lying on a boundary) (bool)
principal_curvature_x - the first component of the direction of the principal curvature at a point (float32)
principal_curvature_y - the second component of the direction of the principal curvature at a point (float32)
principal_curvature_z - the third component of the direction of the principal curvature at a point (float32)
pc1 - the magnitude of the first component of the principal curvature at a point (float32)
pc2 - the magnitude of the second component of the principal curvature at a point (float32)
pfh - the Point Feature Histogram (PFH) feature signature at a point (float32[])
fpfh - the Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) feature signature at a point (float32[])
